### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

AI/ML/TDM specialist with 10+ years of experience in software engineering. 
I have expertise in Text and Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Data Science. 
I'm interested in the development of specialized processes for scientific text, in particular document parsing and structuring. 

I like mostly anything related to the outdoor and travel.
